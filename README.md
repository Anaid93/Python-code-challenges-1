* **CHALLENGE 6** - [Balanced expression](https://github.com/Anaid93/Python-code-challenges-1/blob/main/challenge6.py)

Creates a program that checks if the parentheses, braces and square brackets of an expression are balanced.
   1. Balanced expression: { { [ a * ( c + d ) ] - 5 }
   2. Unbalanced expression: { [ [ a * ( c + d ) ] - 5 }

* **CHALLENGE 7** - [Palindrome ](https://github.com/Anaid93/Python-code-challenges-1/blob/main/challenge7.py)

Write a function that receives a text and returns a Boolean depending on whether or not they are palindromes. A palindrome is a word or expression that is the same whether it is read from left to right or right to left.

* **CHALLENGE 8** - [Armstrong number](https://github.com/Anaid93/Python-code-challenges-1/blob/main/challenge8.py)

Write a function that calculates whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

* **CHALLENGE 9** - [Days-between-two strings/dates](https://github.com/Anaid93/Python-code-challenges-1/blob/main/challenge9.py)

Create a function that calculates and returns how many days there are between two strings representing dates.
   1. A string representing a date has the format ''dd/MM/yyyy''.
   2. The function will receive two Strings and return an Int.
   3. If one of the two text strings does not represent a correct date an exception will be thrown.

* **CHALLENGE 10** - [Uppercase - first letter of each word](https://github.com/Anaid93/Python-code-challenges-1/blob/main/challenge10.py)
